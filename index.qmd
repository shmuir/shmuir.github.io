## Hello!

My name is Sam and I am recent graduate from the Master of Environmental Data Science program at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at the University of California, Santa Barbara. My experience encompasses a range of projects focused on land cover change, spatial modeling, and the impacts of climate change on environmental health. I'm eager to continue developing my environmental data science skills, leverage my experience to help protect our vital ecosystems, and contribute to environmental justice efforts through accessible science communication.
