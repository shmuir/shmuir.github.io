    "text": "Personally\nA big part of my life has been devoted to dinghy sailing, especially during undergrad. I was on the SMCM varsity sailing team and was a captain for two years. During this time, I competed all over the country, ending my sailing career with multiple conference championship victories, a team top-ten national ranking, two All-America titles, and wonderful memories with amazing teammates who became another family.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes music is best enjoyed (and played) outside :)\n\nNow that I’m not sailing as much, I have been able to devote more time to other hobbies including running, playing cello, and transcribing/ arranging music. During 2020, I began arranging music for me and my dad (a flautist) to play together. I mainly use the MuseScore4 engraving software and am working on uploading my transcriptions and arrangements to my MuseScore profile - check it out!"

    "text": "In February 2021, the state of Texas suffered a major energy crisis as a result of three severe winter storms. This left many people without power. Power outages can disproportionately affect marginalized groups and historically lower-income areas can may be of lower priority. For more background: engineering and political perspectives.\nIn this post, I am interested in estimating the number of homes in Houston that lost power as a result of the first two storm and investigating if socioeconomic factors are predictors of community loss of power."

Here I have two tiles for 2021-02-07 and two tiles for 2021-02-16.\n\n\nCode\n# read in night light files using read_stars()\nfeb7_1 &lt;- read_stars(\"data/VNP46A1/VNP46A1.A2021038.h08v05.001.2021039064328.tif\")\nfeb7_2 &lt;- read_stars(\"data/VNP46A1/VNP46A1.A2021038.h08v06.001.2021039064329.tif\")\nfeb16_1 &lt;- read_stars(\"data/VNP46A1/VNP46A1.A2021047.h08v05.001.2021048091106.tif\")\nfeb16_2 &lt;- read_stars(\"data/VNP46A1/VNP46A1.A2021047.h08v06.001.2021048091105.tif\")\n\n\nThe tile pairs now need to be combined to create a full image of out area of interest.\n\n\nCode\n# combine both feb. 7th\nfeb7 &lt;- st_mosaic(feb7_1, feb7_2)\n\n# combine both feb. 16th\nfeb16 &lt;- st_mosaic(feb16_1, feb16_2)\n\n\nNow that we have the full area we can begin finding the difference light intensity.\nTo find if there is a different in the night lights from before and after the storm, I found the different between the light intensity, assuming that any location that experienced a drop of more than 200 nW cm-2sr-1 experienced a power outage.\n\n\nCode\n# finding the difference in night lights\nnight_diff &lt;- (feb7 - feb16)\n#plot(night_diff, main = \"Difference in night light\")\n\n# create a mask, sectioning in to 200 to infinity; the rest become NA\nnight_mask &lt;- cut(night_diff, c(200, Inf), labels = \"outage\")\n\n# the night mask should have one level \"outage\" and NA for the rest; check using:\n# unique(night_mask$VNP46A1.A2021038.h08v05.001.2021039064328.tif)\n\n# vectorizing night_mask using st_as_sf\nnight_mask_vec &lt;- st_as_sf(night_mask) %&gt;%\n  st_make_valid() # fix invalid geometries\n\n# checking that it is now sf data.frame\n# class(night_mask_vec)\n\n\nIn this project I am wanting to specifically look at Houston, and right now, the map covers more area than just Houston. To focus in on Houston, I first need to define the coordinates of the city boundary and then turn them into a polygon and simple features collection.\n\n\nCode\n# creating Houston border with the given coordinates using st_polygon()\nhouston_border &lt;- st_polygon(list(rbind(c(-96.5,29), c(-96.5,30.5), c(-94.5, 30.5), c(-94.5,29), c(-96.5,29)))) # rbind combines objects\n\n# convert to sfc and define crs\nhouston_border_sf &lt;- st_sfc(houston_border, crs = 'EPSG:4326')\n\n\nNow that the boarder is defined, I can use it to crop the blackout mask. Additionally, I need to make sure that both of the objects have the same coordinate reference system (CRS), and in this case, I want to use EPSG:3083 (NAD83 / Texas Centric Albers Equal Area).\n\n\nCode\n# crop using the Houston border\nhouston_mask &lt;- night_mask_vec[houston_border_sf, ,] # subset using the border object\n\n# reproject cropped object to new crs\noutage_mask &lt;- st_transform(houston_mask, crs = 'EPSG:3083')\n#plot(outage_mask)"
