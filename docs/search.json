    "text": "Personally\nA big part of my life has been devoted to dinghy sailing, especially during undergrad. I was on the SMCM varsity sailing team and was a captain for two years. During this time, I competed all over the country, ending my sailing career with multiple conference championship victories, a team top-ten national ranking, two All-America titles, and wonderful memories with amazing teammates who became another family.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes music is best enjoyed (and played) outside :)\n\nNow that I’m not sailing as much, I have been able to devote more time to other hobbies including running, playing cello, and transcribing/ arranging music. During 2020 when playing music with others was not possible, I began arranging music for me and my dad (a flautist) to play together. I mainly use the MuseScore4 engraving software and am working on uploading my transcriptions and arrangements to my MuseScore profile - check it out!"
