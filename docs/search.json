    "text": "Personally\nA big part of my life has been devoted to dinghy sailing, especially during undergrad. I was on the SMCM varsity sailing team and was a captain for two years. During this time, I competed all over the country, ending my sailing career with multiple conference championship victories, a team top-ten national ranking, two All-America titles, and wonderful memories with amazing teammates who became another family.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes music is best enjoyed (and played) outside :)\n\nNow that I’m not sailing as much, I have been able to devote more time to other hobbies including running, playing cello, and transcribing/ arranging music. During 2020, I began arranging music for me and my dad (a flautist) to play together. I mainly use the MuseScore4 engraving software and am working on uploading my transcriptions and arrangements to my MuseScore profile - check it out!"

The samples were collected from four different sites across a natural salinity gradient on the Potomac River at two different times of the year. One collection was performed in spring when Phytophthora spp. is likely to be more active, and at the end of summer when hurricane season starts on the Atlantic coast and there is likely to be increased seawater intrusion.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Map of soil collection locations in Southern Maryland and the salinity."

    "text": "Analysis\nThe abundance of Phytophthora spp. varied by site depending on the season that the soil was collected. In both seasons, it is hard to tell a clear relationship between salinity and Phytophthora abundance. In the spring and summer, there is the highest abundances at the sites with the lowest salinity, but we also see a relatively high abundance at some higher salinity. These results suggest that seawater intrusion and seasonality could modify patterns of Phytophthora spp abundances in coastal soils of Southern Maryland, but further analyses should be done to make any definite conclusions. One possible approach would be to sample soil from a wider salinity range and in colder months as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Mean cfu/ml across sites and seasons."
