During this time, I competed all over the country, ending my sailing career with multiple conference championship victories, a team top-ten national ranking, two All-America titles, and wonderful memories with amazing teammates who became another family.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes music is best enjoyed (and played) outside :)\n\nNow that I’m not sailing as much, I have been able to devote more time to other hobbies including running, playing cello, and transcribing/ arranging music. During 2020, I began arranging music for me and my dad (a flautist) to play together. I mainly use the MuseScore4 engraving software and am working on uploading my transcriptions and arrangements to my MuseScore profile - check it out!"

When trees bloom in April rather than early to mid-May, they are at increased risk for late spring frost killing the blooms (Hoffmann and Rath 2013).\nWe have already seen early bloom affect crop yields, which greatly impacts growers, consumers, and the food industry at large. Tart cherries, which go through a similar growing cycle as apples, are an example of the risk of early bloom and late spring frost (Chapman and Catlin 1976). In 2012, Michigan tart cherry growers harvested under 12 million pounds of fruit, compared to the usual 158 million pounds (Higgins 2019). The trees broke dormancy 5 weeks early and suffered a harsh frost. With this severe decrease in yield, many growers are dealing with the financial impact, and soon, consumers will feel the loss of these important foods as well (Wolfe et al. 2018).\nIn this project, I aimed to investigate temperature patterns over the past 36 years in the Mid-Atlantic region and analyze the relationships between temperature averages, growing degree days1, and full bloom2 dates for the Golden Delicious apple."

All of these sites have characteristics that make them desirable apple-growing locations with minimal probability of frost during bloom. The Hudson Valley has the Hudson River running through the valley, providing irrigation for the trees, and allowing cooler air to settle at the bottom of the valley (United States Department of Agriculture). In Winchester, orchards are located on slopes in the Shenandoah Valley, again allowing the cooler air to settle at lower elevations, keeping the trees warmer and safe from cold damage (Brackett 1910). Rock Springs is a research farm that has been able to use overhead irrigation in the past which can help prevent frost damage (United States Department of Agriculture).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Locations of studied apple orchards."

    "text": "Data Curration and Preparation\nGolden Delicious bloom date data from 1983 to 2019 were obtained from each site. Bloom dates in month/day/year format were converted to day-of-year format, where, for example, January 1st is 1 and February 1st is 32. To analyze how the day of full bloom varies by year and location in response to temperature, I used data from the Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN) for areas close to the study sites (Global Historical Climatology Network 2020, Menne et al. 2012). These data included daily maximum and minimum temperatures for the past 36 years for Rock Springs and Winchester, and the past 23 years for Hudson Valley.\nAs mentioned, growing degree days were calculated as the daily mean temperature, minus the minimum temperature that apple trees start to grow, which in this case, is about 4ºC. This formula yields the growing degree days for one particular day, so GDDs were summed over the expected cold stratification period (February 1st up until the day of full bloom."

Our results do not support the idea that apples will bloom after being exposed to 100 cumulative growing degree days (DeGaetano 2017). The cumulative growing degree days required for bloom ranged from less than 70 to greater than 400, with Winchester often blooming with fewer cumulative growing degree days than the other two locations (Figure 4). This may be due to Winchester’s more southerly location (Figure 2).\nFrom these plots, we cannot accurately predict bloom dates. While overall there is a relationship between growing degree days and the day of full bloom, there is a lot of variation not explained by simple linear regression, indicating that one or more variables are affecting the day of full bloom for these apple trees."

    "text": "Future Steps\nGrowing degree days is the only temperature variable I studied, and in the future, it may be valuable to include different aspects of the temperature data in the model, as well as other factors influencing climate change. We know that there is a chilling requirement for apples, but hours above or below a certain temperature range may influence bloom date (Anderson & Richardson 1986). We also do not know if negative growing degree days affect bloom since those values were converted to 0. Including those negative values in the growing degree day calculations or as an additional variable in the model would change the data for February. Rather than just looking at temperature and bloom date for a single year, temperatures from the previous year may need to be considered. Maximum and minimum temperatures or growing degree days from the previous year may indirectly influence bloom date by affecting carbohydrate levels in the tree (Sperling et al. 2019).\nIn the future, it would also be valuable to analyze data from more southerly locations, such as North or South Carolina orchards. It would be interesting to know if the Winchester data are similar to data from locations further south since these results suggest that the response to cumulative growing degree days may depend on location."

In both seasons, it is hard to tell a clear relationship between salinity and Phytophthora abundance. In the spring and summer, there is the highest abundances at the sites with the lowest salinity, but we also see a relatively high abundance at some higher salinity. These results suggest that seawater intrusion and seasonality could modify patterns of Phytophthora spp abundances in coastal soils of Southern Maryland, but further analyses should be done to make any definite conclusions. One possible approach would be to sample soil from a wider salinity range and in colder months as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Mean cfu/ml across sites and seasons."

    "text": "Earlier this year I started as a Graduate Research Fellow in collaboration with the emLab at UCSB and Conservation International SPARC. During my interview and subsequent on boarding process, I learned that the research would be focused on areas of Southern Africa, mainly the KAZA region. For those unfamiliar with the term KAZA TFCA (as I was initially), it stands for Kavango–Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area, which is one of the largest landscape conservation areas in the world, spanning Angola, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, and Namibia (WWF 2016). It’s a beautiful, diverse area that, focuses on sustainably managing the ecosystem, attracts many tourists, and serves as a hub for various research initiatives.\n\n\n\n\n\nMap of the KAZA TCFA (WWFNamibia 2015).\nSo, what is the focus of our research in KAZA? Broadly, our questions revolve around the effects of climate change on wildlife corridors, human intrusion into these corridors, and the subsequent impacts on human-elephant conflict. Throughout my data analysis and literature review this quarter, I’ve been contemplating the following questions: In what ways can we ensure that our research is relevant and beneficial for the communities we’re studying and using data from? What factors should we keep in mind when conducting and reporting research on communities that we have no personal connections to?\n\n\n\n\n\nElephants in KAZA (WWF 2016).\nTo dive into these questions, I am drawing inspiration from AI Blindspot (Calderon et al. 2019), which was developed during the Berkman Klein Center and MIT Media Lab’s 2019 Assembly program. This guide was developed with AI data and models in mind, but many of the questions and concepts apply to data and research ethics in general. The authors lay out the potential sources of bias & oversight, or “blind spots”, in four sections: Planning, Building, Deploying, and Monitoring."

In this project, we aim to analyze how human activity has altered land cover in wildlife corridors over time and how human presence in relation to the corridors is predicted to change in the future based on current trends. Additionally, we are exploring how the locations of human-elephant conflicts relate to the location of corridors, and what seasonal or climactic variables have the most influence on conflict rates. Results from this research can help inform local communities about potential future dangers to them from elephants, and how their activities are influencing these conflicts.\n\n\nHave you engaged with affected communities? Subject matter experts?\nYes, we have collaborators at the University of Namibia who have been engaging in this field of research for a while. They have conducted village interviews to collect data on human-wildlife conflicts.\n\n\nAbusability\nWhile this research can help further our understanding of human-elephant conflicts and their developments, it’s critical to acknowledge the dual-edged nature of reporting this information. It is possible that government officials could use these findings to implement changes in community activities, potentially restricting access to essential resources. This raises concerns about the responsible use of this data and research outcomes.\n\n\nPrivacy\nPersonal information from the conflict interviews has not been recorded, so people can retain anonymity. When it comes to publishing wildlife research, a major concern revolves around determining who has access to the data due to the potential for malicious use. A majority of elephant data cannot be made publicly available since there are poachers who will use the data for ill intentions."

Do they trust it?\nWhile we do have conflict surveys, I think it would be beneficial to consider conducting a follow-up survey in the same villages once the project results are available. This additional survey would help to gauge the level of trust in our analyses—assessing whether the community understands the analysis process, cares about the results, and finds them consistent with their personal observations of human-elephant conflicts. This approach adds an additional layer of community engagement and ensures that our research is not only informative but incorperates the experiences of those directly impacted.\n\n\nHow rigid should we be when developing our future projections of human-elephant conflict?\nVarious model developments may yield projections that are either lower than actual future impacts, potentially providing a false sense of comfort, or significantly higher than actual future impacts, leading to unnecessary anxiety or harsher regulations."

We have reports of human-elephant conflict, but not the specific information on how the conflict came about. Have increases in reports of conflict occurred because there has been an actual increase in conflict events, or has conflict reporting and recording become common? Are changes in human activity influenced by factors of climate change as much as elephant activity is? We cannot reliably integrate lived experiences into spatial suitability and resistance modeling, but this data can and should be considered when making conclusions from the modeling."

The two plots below should produce a figure with a red background. There should be no yellow figure.\n\nimport matplotlib\nmatplotlib.rcParams.update({'figure.facecolor': 'red',\n                            'savefig.facecolor': 'yellow'})\nplt.figure()\nplt.plot([3, 2, 1])\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\nUAT 16 - Events\nPressing any keyboard key or mouse button (or scrolling) should cycle the line while the figure has focus. The figure should have focus by default when it is created and re-gain it by clicking on the canvas. Clicking anywhere outside of the figure should release focus, but moving the mouse out of the figure should not release focus.\n\nimport itertools\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nx = np.linspace(0,10,10000)\ny = np.sin(x)\nln, = ax.plot(x,y)\nevt = []\ncolors = iter(itertools.cycle(['r', 'g', 'b', 'k', 'c']))\ndef on_event(event):\n    if event.name.startswith('key'):\n        fig.suptitle('%s: %s' % (event.name, event.key))\n    elif event.name == 'scroll_event':\n        fig.suptitle('%s: %s' % (event.name, event.step))\n    else:\n        fig.suptitle('%s: %s' % (event.name, event.button))\n    evt.append(event)\n    ln.set_color(next(colors))\n    fig.canvas.draw()\n    fig.canvas.draw_idle()\n\nfig.canvas.mpl_connect('button_press_event', on_event)\nfig.canvas.mpl_connect('button_release_event', on_event)\nfig.canvas.mpl_connect('scroll_event', on_event)\nfig.canvas.mpl_connect('key_press_event', on_event)\nfig.canvas.mpl_connect('key_release_event', on_event)\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\nUAT 17 - Timers\nSingle-shot timers follow a completely different code path in the nbagg backend than regular timers (such as those used in the animation example above.)

Repeatedly running the cell below should always have the same figure number\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nax.plot(range(5))\nplt.show()\n\nRunning the cell below will re-show the figure.

    "text": "There are many other factors that affect a species’ population trend, but in this project, I am interested in analyzing how a plant species photosynthetic rate and ecological threats influence a species’ odds of having a decreasing population. Additionally, can I use this model to find the log-odds of a plant with an unknown status having a decreasing population trend?"
