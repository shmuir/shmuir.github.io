During this time, I competed all over the country, ending my sailing career with multiple conference championship victories, a team top-ten national ranking, two All-America titles, and wonderful memories with amazing teammates who became another family.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes music is best enjoyed (and played) outside :)\n\nNow that I’m not sailing as much, I have been able to devote more time to other hobbies including running, playing cello, and transcribing/ arranging music. During 2020, I began arranging music for me and my dad (a flautist) to play together. I mainly use the MuseScore4 engraving software and am working on uploading my transcriptions and arrangements to my MuseScore profile - check it out!"

In both seasons, it is hard to tell a clear relationship between salinity and Phytophthora abundance. In the spring and summer, there is the highest abundances at the sites with the lowest salinity, but we also see a relatively high abundance at some higher salinity. These results suggest that seawater intrusion and seasonality could modify patterns of Phytophthora spp abundances in coastal soils of Southern Maryland, but further analyses should be done to make any definite conclusions. One possible approach would be to sample soil from a wider salinity range and in colder months as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Mean cfu/ml across sites and seasons."

When trees bloom in April rather than early to mid-May, they are at increased risk for late spring frost killing the blooms (Hoffmann and Rath 2013).\nWe have already seen early bloom affect crop yields, which greatly impacts growers, consumers, and the food industry at large. Tart cherries, which go through a similar growing cycle as apples, are an example of the risk of early bloom and late spring frost (Chapman and Catlin 1976). In 2012, Michigan tart cherry growers harvested under 12 million pounds of fruit, compared to the usual 158 million pounds (Higgins 2019). The trees broke dormancy 5 weeks early and suffered a harsh frost. With this severe decrease in yield, many growers are dealing with the financial impact, and soon, consumers will feel the loss of these important foods as well (Wolfe et al. 2018).\nIn this project, I aimed to investigate temperature patterns over the past 36 years in the Mid-Atlantic region and analyze the relationships between temperature averages, growing degree days1, and full bloom2 dates for the Golden Delicious apple."

With this severe decrease in yield, many growers are dealing with the financial impact, and soon, consumers will feel the loss of these important foods as well (Wolfe et al. 2018).\nIn this project, I aimed to investigate temperature patterns over the past 36 years in the Mid-Atlantic region and analyze the relationships between temperature averages, growing degree days1, and full bloom2 dates for the Golden Delicious apple."

All of these sites have characteristics that make them desirable apple-growing locations with minimal probability of frost during bloom. The Hudson Valley has the Hudson River running through the valley, providing irrigation for the trees, and allowing cooler air to settle at the bottom of the valley (United States Department of Agriculture). In Winchester, orchards are located on slopes in the Shenandoah Valley, again allowing the cooler air to settle at lower elevations, keeping the trees warmer and safe from cold damage (Brackett 1910). Rock Springs is a research farm that has been able to use overhead irrigation in the past which can help prevent frost damage (United States Department of Agriculture).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Locations of studied apple orchards."

Bloom dates in month/day/year format were converted to day-of-year format, where, for example, January 1st is 1 and February 1st is 32. To analyze how the day of full bloom varies by year and location in response to temperature, I used data from the Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN) for areas close to the study sites (Global Historical Climatology Network 2020, Menne et al. 2012). These data included daily maximum and minimum temperatures for the past 36 years for Rock Springs and Winchester, and the past 23 years for Hudson Valley.\nAs mentioned, growing degree days were calculated as the daily mean temperature, minus the minimum temperature that apple trees start to grow, which in this case, is about 4ºC. This formula yields the growing degree days for one particular day, so GDDs were summed over the expected cold stratification period (February 1st up until the day of full bloom."

Our results do not support the idea that apples will bloom after being exposed to 100 cumulative growing degree days (DeGaetano 2017). The cumulative growing degree days required for bloom ranged from less than 70 to greater than 400, with Winchester often blooming with fewer cumulative growing degree days than the other two locations (Figure 4). This may be due to Winchester’s more southerly location (Figure 2).\nFrom these plots, we cannot accurately predict bloom dates. While overall there is a relationship between growing degree days and the day of full bloom, there is a lot of variation not explained by simple linear regression, indicating that one or more variables are affecting the day of full bloom for these apple trees."

We know that there is a chilling requirement for apples, but hours above or below a certain temperature range may influence bloom date (Anderson & Richardson 1986). We also do not know if negative growing degree days affect bloom since those values were converted to 0. Including those negative values in the growing degree day calculations or as an additional variable in the model would change the data for February. Rather than just looking at temperature and bloom date for a single year, temperatures from the previous year may need to be considered. Maximum and minimum temperatures or growing degree days from the previous year may indirectly influence bloom date by affecting carbohydrate levels in the tree (Sperling et al. 2019).\nIn the future, it would also be valuable to analyze data from more southerly locations, such as North or South Carolina orchards. It would be interesting to know if the Winchester data are similar to data from locations further south since these results suggest that the response to cumulative growing degree days may depend on location."

    "text": "UAT 13 - Animation\nThe following should generate an animated line:\n\nimport matplotlib.animation as animation\nimport numpy as np\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\n\nx = np.arange(0, 2*np.pi, 0.01)        # x-array\nline, = ax.plot(x, np.sin(x))\n\ndef animate(i):\n    line.set_ydata(np.sin(x+i/10.0))  # update the data\n    return line,\n\n#Init only required for blitting to give a clean slate.\ndef init():\n    line.set_ydata(np.ma.array(x, mask=True))\n    return line,\n\nani = animation.FuncAnimation(fig, animate, np.arange(1, 200), init_func=init,\n                              interval=100., blit=True)\nplt.show()\n\n\nUAT 14 - Keyboard shortcuts in IPython after close of figure\nAfter closing the previous figure (with the close button above the figure) the IPython keyboard shortcuts should still function.\n\n\nUAT 15 - Figure face colours\nThe nbagg honours all colours apart from that of the figure.patch. The two plots below should produce a figure with a red background. There should be no yellow figure.\n\nimport matplotlib\nmatplotlib.rcParams.update({'figure.facecolor': 'red',\n                            'savefig.facecolor': 'yellow'})\nplt.figure()\nplt.plot([3, 2, 1])\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\nUAT 16 - Events\nPressing any keyboard key or mouse button (or scrolling) should cycle the line while the figure has focus. The figure should have focus by default when it is created and re-gain it by clicking on the canvas. Clicking anywhere outside of the figure should release focus, but moving the mouse out of the figure should not release focus.\n\nimport itertools\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nx = np.linspace(0,10,10000)\ny = np.sin(x)\nln, = ax.plot(x,y)\nevt = []\ncolors = iter(itertools.cycle(['r', 'g', 'b', 'k', 'c']))\ndef on_event(event):\n    if event.name.startswith('key'):\n        fig.suptitle('%s: %s' % (event.name, event.key))\n    elif event.name == 'scroll_event':\n        fig.suptitle('%s: %s' % (event.name, event.step))\n    else:\n        fig.suptitle('%s: %s' % (event.name, event.button))\n    evt.append(event)\n    ln.set_color(next(colors))\n    fig.canvas.draw()\n    fig.canvas.draw_idle()\n\nfig.canvas.mpl_connect('button_press_event', on_event)\nfig.canvas.mpl_connect('button_release_event', on_event)\nfig.canvas.mpl_connect('scroll_event', on_event)\nfig.canvas.mpl_connect('key_press_event', on_event)\nfig.canvas.mpl_connect('key_release_event', on_event)\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\nUAT 17 - Timers\nSingle-shot timers follow a completely different code path in the nbagg backend than regular timers (such as those used in the animation example above.) The next set of tests ensures that both “regular” and “single-shot” timers work properly.\nThe following should show a simple clock that updates twice a second:\n\nimport time\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\ntext = ax.text(0.5, 0.5, '', ha='center')\n\ndef update(text):\n    text.set(text=time.ctime())\n    text.axes.figure.canvas.draw()\n    \ntimer = fig.canvas.new_timer(500, [(update, [text], {})])\ntimer.start()\nplt.show()\n\nHowever, the following should only update once and then stop:\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\ntext = ax.text(0.5, 0.5, '', ha='center') \ntimer = fig.canvas.new_timer(500, [(update, [text], {})])\n\ntimer.single_shot = True\ntimer.start()\n\nplt.show()\n\nAnd the next two examples should never show any visible text at all:\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\ntext = ax.text(0.5, 0.5, '', ha='center')\ntimer = fig.canvas.new_timer(500, [(update, [text], {})])\n\ntimer.start()\ntimer.stop()\n\nplt.show()\n\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\ntext = ax.text(0.5, 0.5, '', ha='center')\ntimer = fig.canvas.new_timer(500, [(update, [text], {})])\n\ntimer.single_shot = True\ntimer.start()\ntimer.stop()\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\nUAT 18 - stopping figure when removed from DOM\nWhen the div that contains from the figure is removed from the DOM the figure should shut down it’s comm, and if the python-side figure has no more active comms, it should destroy the figure. Repeatedly running the cell below should always have the same figure number\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nax.plot(range(5))\nplt.show()\n\nRunning the cell below will re-show the figure. After this, re-running the cell above should result in a new figure number.\n\nfig.canvas.manager.reshow()\n\n\n\nUAT 19 - Blitting\nClicking on the figure should plot a green horizontal line moving up the axes.\n\nimport itertools\n\ncnt = itertools.count()\nbg = None\n\ndef onclick_handle(event):\n    \"\"\"Should draw elevating green line on each mouse click\"\"\"\n    global bg\n    if bg is None:\n        bg = ax.figure.canvas.copy_from_bbox(ax.bbox) \n    ax.figure.canvas.restore_region(bg)\n\n    cur_y = (next(cnt) % 10) * 0.1\n    ln.set_ydata([cur_y, cur_y])\n    ax.draw_artist(ln)\n    ax.figure.canvas.blit(ax.bbox)\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nax.plot([0, 1], [0, 1], 'r')\nln, = ax.plot([0, 1], [0, 0], 'g', animated=True)\nplt.show()\nax.figure.canvas.draw()\n\nax.figure.canvas.mpl_connect('button_press_event', onclick_handle)"
