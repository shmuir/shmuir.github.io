During 2020, I began arranging music for me and my dad (a flautist) to play together. I mainly use the MuseScore4 engraving software and am working on uploading my transcriptions and arrangements to my MuseScore profile - check it out!"

In both seasons, it is hard to tell a clear relationship between salinity and Phytophthora abundance. In the spring and summer, there is the highest abundances at the sites with the lowest salinity, but we also see a relatively high abundance at some higher salinity. These results suggest that seawater intrusion and seasonality could modify patterns of Phytophthora spp abundances in coastal soils of Southern Maryland, but further analyses should be done to make any definite conclusions. One possible approach would be to sample soil from a wider salinity range and in colder months as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Mean cfu/ml across sites and seasons."

The trees broke dormancy 5 weeks early and suffered a harsh frost. With this severe decrease in yield, many growers are dealing with the financial impact, and soon, consumers will feel the loss of these important foods as well (Wolfe et al. 2018).\nIn this project, I aimed to investigate temperature patterns over the past 36 years in the Mid-Atlantic region and analyze the relationships between temperature averages, growing degree days1, and full bloom2 dates for the Golden Delicious apple."

All of these sites have characteristics that make them desirable apple-growing locations with minimal probability of frost during bloom. The Hudson Valley has the Hudson River running through the valley, providing irrigation for the trees, and allowing cooler air to settle at the bottom of the valley (United States Department of Agriculture). In Winchester, orchards are located on slopes in the Shenandoah Valley, again allowing the cooler air to settle at lower elevations, keeping the trees warmer and safe from cold damage (Brackett 1910). Rock Springs is a research farm that has been able to use overhead irrigation in the past which can help prevent frost damage (United States Department of Agriculture).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Locations of studied apple orchards."

    "text": "Data Curration and Preparation\nGolden Delicious bloom date data from 1983 to 2019 were obtained from each site. Bloom dates in month/day/year format were converted to day-of-year format, where, for example, January 1st is 1 and February 1st is 32. To analyze how the day of full bloom varies by year and location in response to temperature, I used data from the Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN) for areas close to the study sites (Global Historical Climatology Network 2020, Menne et al. 2012). These data included daily maximum and minimum temperatures for the past 36 years for Rock Springs and Winchester, and the past 23 years for Hudson Valley.\nAs mentioned, growing degree days were calculated as the daily mean temperature, minus the minimum temperature that apple trees start to grow, which in this case, is about 4ºC. This formula yields the growing degree days for one particular day, so GDDs were summed over the expected cold stratification period (February 1st up until the day of full bloom."

Our results do not support the idea that apples will bloom after being exposed to 100 cumulative growing degree days (DeGaetano 2017). The cumulative growing degree days required for bloom ranged from less than 70 to greater than 400, with Winchester often blooming with fewer cumulative growing degree days than the other two locations (Figure 4). This may be due to Winchester’s more southerly location (Figure 2).\nFrom these plots, we cannot accurately predict bloom dates. While overall there is a relationship between growing degree days and the day of full bloom, there is a lot of variation not explained by simple linear regression, indicating that one or more variables are affecting the day of full bloom for these apple trees."

    "text": "Future Steps\nGrowing degree days is the only temperature variable I studied, and in the future, it may be valuable to include different aspects of the temperature data in the model, as well as other factors influencing climate change. We know that there is a chilling requirement for apples, but hours above or below a certain temperature range may influence bloom date (Anderson & Richardson 1986). We also do not know if negative growing degree days affect bloom since those values were converted to 0. Including those negative values in the growing degree day calculations or as an additional variable in the model would change the data for February. Rather than just looking at temperature and bloom date for a single year, temperatures from the previous year may need to be considered. Maximum and minimum temperatures or growing degree days from the previous year may indirectly influence bloom date by affecting carbohydrate levels in the tree (Sperling et al. 2019).\nIn the future, it would also be valuable to analyze data from more southerly locations, such as North or South Carolina orchards. It would be interesting to know if the Winchester data are similar to data from locations further south since these results suggest that the response to cumulative growing degree days may depend on location."
