    "text": "Personally\nA big part of my life has been devoted to dinghy sailing, especially during undergrad. I was on the SMCM varsity sailing team and was a captain for two years. During this time, I competed all over the country, ending my sailing career with multiple conference championship victories, a team top-ten national ranking, two All-America titles, and wonderful memories with amazing teammates who became another family.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes music is best enjoyed (and played) outside :)\n\nNow that I’m not sailing as much, I have been able to devote more time to other hobbies including running, playing cello, and transcribing/ arranging music. During 2020, I began arranging music for me and my dad (a flautist) to play together. I mainly use the MuseScore4 engraving software and am working on uploading my transcriptions and arrangements to my MuseScore profile - check it out!"

In both seasons, it is hard to tell a clear relationship between salinity and Phytophthora abundance. In the spring and summer, there is the highest abundances at the sites with the lowest salinity, but we also see a relatively high abundance at some higher salinity. These results suggest that seawater intrusion and seasonality could modify patterns of Phytophthora spp abundances in coastal soils of Southern Maryland, but further analyses should be done to make any definite conclusions. One possible approach would be to sample soil from a wider salinity range and in colder months as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Mean cfu/ml across sites and seasons."

    "text": "Deciduous trees, including apple, have been blooming earlier, and it is suspected that this is due to increasing late winter and early spring temperatures. When trees bloom in April rather than early to mid-May, they are at increased risk for late spring frost killing the blooms (Hoffmann and Rath 2013).\nWe have already seen early bloom affect crop yields, which greatly impacts growers, consumers, and the food industry at large. Tart cherries, which go through a similar growing cycle as apples, are an example of the risk of early bloom and late spring frost (Chapman and Catlin 1976). In 2012, Michigan tart cherry growers harvested under 12 million pounds of fruit, compared to the usual 158 million pounds (Higgins 2019). The trees broke dormancy 5 weeks early and suffered a harsh frost. With this severe decrease in yield, many growers are dealing with the financial impact, and soon, consumers will feel the loss of these important foods as well (Wolfe et al. 2018).\nIn this project, I aimed to investigate temperature patterns over the past 36 years in the Mid-Atlantic region and analyze the relationships between temperature averages, growing degree days1, and full bloom2 dates for the Golden Delicious apple."

    "text": "Deciduous trees, including apple, have been blooming earlier, and it is suspected that this is due to increasing late winter and early spring temperatures. When trees bloom in April rather than early to mid-May, they are at increased risk for late spring frost killing the blooms (Hoffmann and Rath 2013).\nWe have already seen early bloom affect crop yields, which greatly impacts growers, consumers, and the food industry at large. Tart cherries, which go through a similar growing cycle as apples, are an example of the risk of early bloom and late spring frost (Chapman and Catlin 1976). In 2012, Michigan tart cherry growers harvested under 12 million pounds of fruit, compared to the usual 158 million pounds (Higgins 2019). The trees broke dormancy 5 weeks early and suffered a harsh frost. With this severe decrease in yield, many growers are dealing with the financial impact, and soon, consumers will feel the loss of these important foods as well (Wolfe et al. 2018).\nIn this project, I aimed to investigate temperature patterns over the past 36 years in the Mid-Atlantic region and analyze the relationships between temperature averages, growing degree days1, and full bloom2 dates for the Golden Delicious apple."
