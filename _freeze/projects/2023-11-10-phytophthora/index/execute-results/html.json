The oomycete *Phytophthora spp.* is responsible for many plant diseases that have had significant environmental and economic consequences [@klinkowski1970]. Recently, invasive *P. ramorum* has been detected in Maryland, raising concerns about the health of native coastal flora, particularly under climate change [@marylanddepartmentofagriculture2017]. \n\n::: {.cell .column-margin}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Pipetting PARPH media onto petri dishes to prepare for oomycete plating.](sam_plate.jpg){width=1120}\n:::\n:::\n\nIncreased salinity in soil imposes similar physiological stress as drought does in native plants [@sanogo2004]. Therefore, I explored whether seawater intrusion would promote higher abundances of *Phytophthora spp.* in coastal soils of Southern Maryland due to potentially having higher plant infections caused by salinity stress.\n\n## Soil Collection\n\nSoil sampling was performed by Jordan Manns and Mel Byrne for their research in Dr. Torres-Martínez\\'s lab. The samples were collected from four different sites across a natural salinity gradient on the Potomac River at two different times of the year. One collection was performed in spring when *Phytophthora spp.* is likely to be more active, and at the end of summer when hurricane season starts on the Atlantic coast and there is likely to be increased seawater intrusion.\n\n\n::: {.cell .caption-margin}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Map of soil collection locations in Southern Maryland and the salinity.](index_files/figure-html/fig-main-margin-cap-1.png){#fig-main-margin-cap width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Culturing\n\n\n::: {.cell .column-margin}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Agar plug culture of *Phytophthora*!](phytop.jpg){width=1386}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe abundance of *Phytophthora spp.* was determined by performing serial dilutions of soil samples, plating them on the highly selective PARPH media, and incubating them at 25ºC. Colonies were counted after 4 days of incubation. \n\n## Analysis\n\nThe abundance of *Phytophthora spp.* varied by site depending on the season that the soil was collected. In both seasons, it is hard to tell a clear relationship between salinity and *Phytophthora* abundance. In the spring and summer, there is the highest abundances at the sites with the lowest salinity, but we also see a relatively high abundance at some higher salinity. These results suggest that seawater intrusion and seasonality could modify patterns of *Phytophthora spp* abundances in coastal soils of Southern Maryland, but further analyses should be done to make any definite conclusions. One possible approach would be to sample soil from a wider salinity range and in colder months as well.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell .caption-margin}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Mean cfu/ml across sites and seasons.](index_files/figure-html/fig-bar-1.png){#fig-bar width=672}\n:::\n:::\n",
