When trees bloom in April rather than early to mid-May, they are at increased risk for late spring frost killing the blooms [@hoffmann2013].\n\nWe have already seen early bloom affect crop yields, which greatly impacts growers, consumers, and the food industry at large. Tart cherries, which go through a similar growing cycle as apples, are an example of the risk of early bloom and late spring frost [@chapman1976]. In 2012, Michigan tart cherry growers harvested under 12 million pounds of fruit, compared to the usual 158 million pounds [@higgins2019]. The trees broke dormancy 5 weeks early and suffered a harsh frost. With this severe decrease in yield, many growers are dealing with the financial impact, and soon, consumers will feel the loss of these important foods as well [@wolfe2018].\n\nIn this project, I aimed to investigate temperature patterns over the past 36 years in the Mid-Atlantic region and analyze the relationships between temperature averages, growing degree days[^1], and full bloom[^2] dates for the Golden Delicious apple.\n\n[^1]: Growing degree days are a measure of temperature accumulation. Growing Degree Days = ((Maximum Daily Temp + Minimum Daily Temp) /2 ) - minimum temperature that apple trees start to grow\n\n[^2]: The date at which the maximum number of buds have opened before petals begin to fall off the flowers.\n\n## Study Area\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Data Curation and Preperation\n\nData was gathered from... - 4 vs 7.22 vs 9 degrees\n\n## Linear Regression Analysis\n\n## Closing Thoughts\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = low_temp_4 ~ year + location, data = gdd)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-179.510  -45.375    4.411   29.912  205.628 \n\nCoefficients:\n                       Estimate Std.
