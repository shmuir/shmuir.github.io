## {{< fa bacteria >}} Professionally

I'm a Masters of Environmental Data Science student at the Bren School at the University of California, Santa Barbara. I am also an Arnhold Environmental Fellow collaborating with the [emLab](https://emlab.ucsb.edu/) and Conservation International, focusing on elephant connectivity under climate change.

Previously, I completed my undergraduate degrees in Biology and Environmental Studies (+ French Minor) at St. Mary's College of Maryland (SMCM). There, I had two main areas I focused on: plant sciences and coastal ecology. I conducted research on plant-microbe interactions and the effect of salinity in a [plant ecology lab](https://ltorresmartinez.com/) where I was also the lab manager for my last 6 months there. My undergraduate thesis was on measuring wave mitigation of constructed oyster reefs using DIY wave gauges, and I continued research with my same [thesis adviser](https://gurbisz-coastal-ecology.netlify.app/) on submerged aquatic vegetation. A big reoccurring theme is my love for plants! Towards the end of my undergrad, I also discovered my passion for environmental data science and began to merge these two themes.

## {{< fa sailboat >}} Personally

A big part of my life has been devoted to dinghy sailing, especially during undergrad. I was on the [SMCM varsity sailing team](https://smcmathletics.com/sports/sailing/roster/sam-muir/6316) and was a captain for two years. During this time, I competed all over the country, ending my sailing career with multiple conference championship victories, a team top-ten national ranking, two All-America titles, and wonderful memories with amazing teammates who became another family.

Sometimes music is best enjoyed (and played) outside :)

Now that I'm not sailing as much, I have been able to devote more time to other hobbies including running, playing cello, and transcribing/ arranging music. During 2020 when playing music with others was not possible, I began arranging music for me and my dad (a flautist) to play together. I mainly use the MuseScore4 engraving software and am working on uploading my transcriptions and arrangements to my MuseScore profile - [check it out!](https://musescore.com/user/29095840)
